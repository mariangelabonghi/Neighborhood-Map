# Project: Neighborhood Map
###### In this project is developed a single-page application featuring a map of my favourite places in Puglia. Knockout framework is used. The functionalities included to this application are: map markers to identify locations, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. Ajax is used to retrieve Wikipedia information about the locations.
